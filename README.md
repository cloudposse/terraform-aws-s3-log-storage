# terraform-aws-s3-log-storage [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-log-storage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-log-storage) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-log-storage.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-log-storage/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


This module creates an S3 bucket suitable for receiving logs from other `AWS` services such as `S3`, `CloudFront`, and `CloudTrails`.

It implements a configurable log retention policy, which allows you to efficiently manage logs across different storage classes (_e.g._ `Glacier`) and ultimately expire the data altogether.

It enables server-side default encryption.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| acl | (Optional) The canned ACL to apply. We recommend log-delivery-write for compatibility with AWS services | string | `log-delivery-write` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `policy` or `role`) | list | `<list>` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `name`, `namespace`, `stage`, etc. | string | `-` | no |
| enabled | Is module enabled | string | `true` | no |
| expiration_days | Number of days after which to expunge the objects | string | `90` | no |
| force_destroy | (Optional, Default:false ) A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable. | string | `false` | no |
| glacier_transition_days | Number of days after which to move the data to the glacier storage tier | string | `60` | no |
| kms_master_key_id | The AWS KMS master key ID used for the SSE-KMS encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of sse_algorithm as aws:kms. The default aws/s3 AWS KMS master key is used if this element is absent while the sse_algorithm is aws:kms | string | `` | no |
| lifecycle_rule_enabled | (Optional) enable lifecycle events on this bucket | string | `true` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `db`) | string | - | yes |
| namespace | Namespace (e.g. `cp` or `cloudposse`) | string | - | yes |
| noncurrent_version_expiration_days | (Optional) Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. | string | `90` | no |
| noncurrent_version_transition_days | (Optional) Specifies when noncurrent object versions transitions | string | `30` | no |
| policy | A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a terraform plan. In this case, please make sure you use the verbose/specific version of the policy. | string | `` | no |
| prefix | (Optional) Key prefix. Used to manage object lifecycle events. | string | `` | no |
| region | (Optional) If specified, the AWS region this bucket should reside in. Otherwise, the region used by the callee. | string | `` | no |
| sse_algorithm | The server-side encryption algorithm to use. Valid values are AES256 and aws:kms | string | `AES256` | no |
| stage | Stage (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`) | string | - | yes |
| standard_transition_days | Number of days to persist in the standard storage tier before moving to the infrequent access tier | string | `30` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map('BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`) | map | `<map>` | no |
| versioning_enabled | (Optional) A state of versioning. Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. | string | `false` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| bucket_arn | Bucket ARN |
| bucket_domain_name | FQDN of bucket |
| bucket_id | Bucket Name (aka ID) |
| enabled | Is module enabled |
| prefix | Prefix configured for lifecycle rules |
