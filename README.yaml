  This module creates an S3 bucket suitable for receiving logs from other `AWS` services such as `S3`, `CloudFront`, and `CloudTrails`.

  **WARNING:** Changes introduced in version 0.27.0 present a **HIGH RISK OF DATA LOSS** when upgrading from an
  earlier version. This warning does not apply to new deployments created with version 0.28.0 or later, but 
  if upgrading from an earlier version, please follow the 
  [upgrade instructions](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-log-storage/wiki/Upgrading-to-v0.27.0-(POTENTIAL-DATA-LOSS))
  in this repo's Wiki.
  
  This module implements a configurable log retention policy, which allows you to efficiently manage logs across different storage classes (_e.g._ `Glacier`) and ultimately expire the data altogether.

  It enables server-side default encryption.

  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html

  It blocks public access to the bucket by default.

  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html
  
  As of March, 2022, this module is primarily a wrapper around our 
  [s3-bucket](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket)
  module, with some options preconfigured and SQS notifications added. If it does not exactly suit your needs,
  you may want to use the `s3-bucket` module directly.
