## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| abort\_incomplete\_multipart\_upload\_days | Maximum time (in days) that you want to allow multipart uploads to remain in progress | `number` | `5` | no |
| acl | The canned ACL to apply. We recommend log-delivery-write for compatibility with AWS services | `string` | `"log-delivery-write"` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `policy` or `role`) | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| block\_public\_acls | Set to `false` to disable the blocking of new public access lists on the bucket | `bool` | `true` | no |
| block\_public\_policy | Set to `false` to disable the blocking of new public policies on the bucket | `bool` | `true` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `name`, `namespace`, `stage`, etc. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| enable\_glacier\_transition | Enables the transition to AWS Glacier which can cause unnecessary costs for huge amount of small files | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enabled | Set to `false` to prevent the module from creating any resources | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment, e.g. 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', 'pre-prod', 'UAT' | `string` | `""` | no |
| expiration\_days | Number of days after which to expunge the objects | `number` | `90` | no |
| force\_destroy | (Optional, Default:false ) A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable | `bool` | `false` | no |
| glacier\_transition\_days | Number of days after which to move the data to the glacier storage tier | `number` | `60` | no |
| ignore\_public\_acls | Set to `false` to disable the ignoring of public access lists on the bucket | `bool` | `true` | no |
| kms\_master\_key\_arn | The AWS KMS master key ARN used for the SSE-KMS encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of sse\_algorithm as aws:kms. The default aws/s3 AWS KMS master key is used if this element is absent while the sse\_algorithm is aws:kms | `string` | `""` | no |
| lifecycle\_prefix | Prefix filter. Used to manage object lifecycle events | `string` | `""` | no |
| lifecycle\_rule\_enabled | Enable lifecycle events on this bucket | `bool` | `true` | no |
| lifecycle\_tags | Tags filter. Used to manage object lifecycle events | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `db`) | `string` | n/a | yes |
| namespace | Namespace (e.g. `cp` or `cloudposse`) | `string` | `""` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_expiration\_days | Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire | `number` | `90` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_transition\_days | Specifies when noncurrent object versions transitions | `number` | `30` | no |
| policy | A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a terraform plan. In this case, please make sure you use the verbose/specific version of the policy | `string` | `""` | no |
| region | If specified, the AWS region this bucket should reside in. Otherwise, the region used by the callee | `string` | `""` | no |
| restrict\_public\_buckets | Set to `false` to disable the restricting of making the bucket public | `bool` | `true` | no |
| sse\_algorithm | The server-side encryption algorithm to use. Valid values are AES256 and aws:kms | `string` | `"AES256"` | no |
| stage | Stage (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`) | `string` | `""` | no |
| standard\_transition\_days | Number of days to persist in the standard storage tier before moving to the infrequent access tier | `number` | `30` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map('BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`)` | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| versioning\_enabled | A state of versioning. Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket | `bool` | `false` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| bucket\_arn | Bucket ARN |
| bucket\_domain\_name | FQDN of bucket |
| bucket\_id | Bucket Name (aka ID) |
| enabled | Is module enabled |
| prefix | Prefix configured for lifecycle rules |
